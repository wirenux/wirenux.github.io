# 🆚 GB Hello World, ASM Vs C

Did you ever want to know if a simple Game Boy ASM program is more efficient than a Game Boy C program ?

So you are the correct place. ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵) ✧

I'm going to show you why and how an ASM program can be smaller, faster, and more direct than a C program for the Game Boy.

## Overview

In this project I'm going to use [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) and [GDBK-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) to show `Hello World` on the Game Boy Screen

This project contains **2 Hello World programs** (1 in ASM and 1 in C):

1. [`main.asm`](https://github.com/wirenux/ASM-VS-C-GB/blob/main/Asm/main.asm) → written in **Assembly with RGBDS**
2. [`main.c`](https://github.com/wirenux/ASM-VS-C-GB/blob/main/C/main.c) → written in **C using GBDK**

## File Size

To compare the ROM size i've used:

```bash
stat -c %s hello-asm.gb hello-c.gb
```

Which give me:

|  ROM  |  Size (bytes)  |              Notes             |
|:-----:|:--------------:|--------------------------------|
|  ASM  |     16384      |       Just instructions        |
|   C   |     32768      | Includes GBDK runtime overhead |

> ASM is more efficient in terms of size

To get ASM file to `16Kb` i've used some technics.

1st, i've removed `INCLUDE "hardware.inc"` (it's "just" some macros) because I don't need it just for 4 terms so I've remplaced the macros by with the real addresses so you can remove `~23Kb` of the final weight.

2nd, with `GBDK` when you do a `printf("some text")` he will import `101` tiles to get all symbols needed (see image). So if you define your own font (tiles) you can reduce the size of the final file.

Here is my own font to print `Hello World`:

## Output Screenshot

As you can tell there is literally no difference (graphically) between the C and ASM ROM:

## Build it

### Requirements

- [RGBDS](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/) (assembler and linker) for ASM
- [GBDK-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) for C
- An Game Boy emulator (or even better a real one)

### Compile ASM

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wirenux/ASM-VS-C-GB.git
cd ASM-VS-C-GB
make
```

Then run the ROMs with Emulicious or any Game Boy emulator to see the result.

Explanation :
`rgbasm`  -> compiles `main.asm` into a `asm.o`
`rgblink` -> links `asm.o` into a GB ROM
`rgbfix`  -> fixes the header and ensures correct size

### Compile C

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wirenux/ASM-VS-C-GB.git
cd ASM-VS-C-GB
make hello-c.gb
```

Then run the ROMs with Emulicious or any Game Boy emulator to see the result.

Explanation :
`lcc` -> compiles `main.c` into a GB ROM

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed creating this small program in ASM and I learned a lot in the process.
Manually managing everything: tiles, tilemaps, V-Blank, screen control, and other low-level details was definitely challenging.

That said, I will probably use ASM more often than C for small Game Boy projects.
C works perfectly fine and I definitely recommend it for ease of use, but ASM is way more fun and gives you full control over the hardware.
